nullx is a Dart toolkit that enhances handling of nullable types, providing utilities for null-checking, navigating nullable structures, and robust error handling, for cleaner and more resilient code.

## Features

- Provides utilities for null-checking
- Helps in navigating nullable structures
- Offers robust error handling

## Getting started ðŸŽ‰

To use this package, add `nullx` as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

```dart
dependencies:
  nullx: ^latest_version
```

Here is a simple example of how to use nullx:

```dart
import 'package:nullx/nullx.dart';

void main() {
  const String? nullableString = 'example';
  unwrapped(nullableString, (value) {});

  final List<String?> strings = [null, 'one', null, 'two', null];
  strings.map((s) => s.letNonNull((s) => s.length)).whereType<int>().toList();
}
```

```dart
import 'package:nullx/nullx.dart';

void main() {
    const int? nullableInt = 10;
    final resultInt = nullableInt.letNonNull((value) => value * 2);
}
```
